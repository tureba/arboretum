/**
* This class is the base class for all implementations of the query hint
* classes. A query hint is a special class that is used by some metric tree
* operations to store information about previous executions. This information
* can be used to enhance the performance of sucessive executions of the same
* operation.
*
* <p>Since each combination of operation/metric tree requires a specific type
* of information, each metric tree must implement its own set of query hint
* classes.
*
* <p>Users should not create instances of this class. Each tree has a method
* called stMetricTree::CreateQueryHint() which must be used to create the
* proper hint for each combination of mteric tree/query hint type.
*
* <p>For further information about this concept, see the library architecture
* documentation.
